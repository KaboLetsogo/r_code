Question 1 imports

```{r}
library(moments)
library(tidyverse)
require(lattice)
file_path <- "STAT 308 BIOSTATS/lead-iq.txt"
iq_data <- read.table(file_path, sep = "\t", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
iq_data$Smelter <- as.factor(iq_data$Smelter)
iq_data$IQ <- as.numeric(iq_data$IQ)
iq_data$IQ[is.na(iq_data$IQ)] <- mean(iq_data$IQ)
```

```{r}
# Correct the file path relative to the current working directory
file_path <- "STAT 308 BIOSTATS/lead-iq.txt"

# Read the file using read.table with the correct path
iq_data <- read.table(file_path, sep = "\t", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#
```

```{r}
str(iq_data)
```

Q1a : Make a table listing the mean, 1st quartile, 2nd quartile, 3rd quartile, skewness, Kurtosis, and standard deviation for each group.

```{r}
iq_data%>%group_by(Smelter)%>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(IQ),
    Q1 = quantile(IQ,0.25),
    Q2 = quantile(IQ,0.5),
    Q3 = quantile(IQ,0.75),
    Skewness = skewness(IQ),
    Kurtosis = kurtosis(IQ),
    Std_Dev = sd(IQ) 
  )
```

b)  Create a histogram for each group.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iq_data,aes(x=IQ))+
  geom_histogram(bins=10)+
  facet_grid('Smelter')
```

c)  Create box plots comparing the distribution of IQ between the two groups. Does living close to the smelter appear to be harmful to the neuro- logical development of children?

```{r}
ggplot(data = iq_data,aes(x=IQ))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid('Smelter')
```

```         
The desc and the plots seem to suggest that ...

NB: Assuming serum cholesterol levels are normally distributed and therefore their sampling distribution is also normally distributed with mean 211 mg/dl, and a standard deviation of 46 mg/dl

Q2(a):What is the probability that our sample average will be above 230mg/dl?
```

```{r}
mean <- 211  # population mean
std_dev <- 46  # population standard deviation
n <- 10  # sample size

SE <- std_dev / sqrt(n) #Standard_Error
t_score <- (230 - mean) / SE
df <- n - 1
p_abv_230 <- 1 - pt(t_score, df)
p_abv_230
```

```         
2b
```

```{r}
1 - pnorm(230, mean, std_dev)
```

```         
# c) 95% Confidence interval for our sample averages
```

```{r}

a <- 0.05
t_crit <- qt(1 - a/2, df)
margin_of_error <- t_crit * SE
ci_lower <- mean - margin_of_error
ci_upper <- mean + margin_of_error
c(ci_lower,ci_upper)
```

```         
2d) Width of the interval
```

```{r}
ci_width <- ci_upper - ci_lower
ci_width
```

```         
e) How large would the sample size need to be in order to ensure a 95%
probability that the sample average will be within 5 mg/dl of the population
mean?
```

```         
z_0.025 = 1.96,w=5,sigma=46
```

```{r}
n1 <- ((1.96*46)/5)^2
n1

```

```         
Therefore minimun people needed is 326
```

```         
f) How large would the sample size need to be in order to ensure a 90%
probability that the sample average will be within 5 mg/dl of the population
mean?
```

```{r}
n2 <- ((1.645*46)/5)^2
n2

```

```         
Therefore minimun people needed is 230
```

```         
Q3 : In a six-sided dice, a 1 is called an ace. What is the probability of rolling 24 pairs of dice and getting at least one double-ace?
```

```         
Assuming fair , p=1/6 , n = 24 trials ,P(X>=1) == 1 - P(X=0)
```

```{r}
atleast_1_one_dice <- 1 - dbinom(x=0, size=24, prob=(1/6))
atleast_1_one_dice
```

```         
Q4a) Predict the educational level of a woman (X') whose husband has completed 18 years of schooling (Y)
```

```{r}
mean_X <- 12    # Mean education level for wives
SD_X <- 3       # SD of education level for wives
mean_Y <- 12.5  # Mean education level for husbands
SD_Y <- 2.5     # SD of education level for husbands
r <- 0.5        # Correlation coefficient

z_Y <- (18 - mean_Y) / SD_Y
z_X <- r * z_Y
# Unstandardize to get the predicted value of X
X_pred <- mean_X + z_X * SD_X
X_pred
```

```         
4b) Predict the educational level of a man (Y') whose wife has completed 15 years of schooling (X)
```

```{r}
z_X <- (15 - mean_X) / SD_X
z_Y <- r * z_X
# Unstandardize to get the predicted value of Y
Y_pred <- mean_Y + z_Y * SD_Y
Y_pred
```

```         
Q5

The study obtained an intercept of 55 and a slope of 2.2 per
condition.
a) What is the predicted quality of care for a patient with no chronic
conditions?
```

```{r}

```

```         
b) What is the predicted quality of care for a patient with 2 chronic
conditions?
```

```{r}

```

```         
c) The correlation between quality of care and number of chronic condi-
tions (i) is positive (ii) is negative (iii) could be either positive or negative â€“
it is impossible to tell from the information given
```

```{r}

```

```         
d) You do not have enough information to calculate the correlation co-
efficient from the slope of the regression line. What additional information
would you need to calculate it?
2

```{r}
